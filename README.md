# MDST Tutorials - FA25

### Check out our onboarding website with centralized resources [here](https://mdst-club.notion.site/MDST-Onboarding-3d1b3591dd224115a548325a7d66a723)!

If there are any issues or areas of improvement you would like us to know, please create a new entry in "Issues" 

## Setup

If you haven't already, fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWowsKmEHkGCFQl-IM36JCPknYVdHxKoKFn_ClubupgdaYSg/viewform?usp=header) and join our mailing list. This will keep you up-to-date on the club.

1. Download the files in this repo by clicking `Code` (the green button near the top) -> `Download ZIP` and unzip the files into a folder. You can of course also fork the repo if you have experience with Git.

2. Follow the general setup [guide](https://mdst-club.notion.site/General-Setup-Guide-f801e1c932e440ab8387330b41fcbe77).

3. Follow the Git setup [guide](https://www.notion.so/mdst-club/Git-Setup-Guide-fa635f302a74491fb018892cd1da4697).

For most people, (3) is the _hardest_ part of the tutorial! If you feel frustrated, know it is normal. Come see us at tutorials or office hours and we will help you out.

### What do I do if I cannot get the setup working in time?

If you have trouble with the _General Setup_, you can follow the Google Colab setup [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ely7Xi_r1AFLAsMrKuHHcwqgAMnWV4QrbnK_uTJzYc/edit?usp=sharing) and use Colab to complete the tutorials.

If you have trouble with the _Git Setup_, you can upload your files to Git by going to your GitHub repository and do `Add file` -> `Upload files`.

## Tutorials & Checkpoints

Get started with `tutorial0` and `checkpoint0` in the `tutorial0` folder and then move on to `tutorial1` and `checkpoint1` in the `tutorial1` folder. We recommend working through each tutorial before attempting the corresponding checkpoint. However, if you have prior experience, feel free to skip part of or entire tutorial.

The `Data-Visualization` folder contains materials for those who want to get a head start. `pandas.ipynb` is a very brief introduction to internal Pandas data visualization tools. The `AnatomyofMatplotlib` folder contains a comprehensive tutorial for the Matplotlib library, which most beginner projects use and is foundational to other data visualization packages such as `seaborn`.

We also highly recommend you looking into Python virtual environments. You can do this at the beginning or after you complete the checkpoints. Our members have made resources explaining it [here](https://www.notion.so/mdst-club/Python-Virtual-Environment-2afafcef293f4f6ca03cec867a51fe4f).

## Challenges (Optional)

There are three optional challenges available to you: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and RvF. They are located in three seperate folders under `Optional-Challenges` and your code will be needed in the notebooks ending in `.ipynb`.

You can choose to complete any one or multiple of them. We usually put new members on beginner or intermediate projects for their very first semester but you may want to work on advanced projects right away if you are experienced with data science. In that case, completion of **at least one** challenge will be required.

### Themes:

Machine Learning - Loan Approval Prediction

Deep Learning - Titanic

RvF - Computer Vision: Fake Face Detection

## How we are supporting you

These checkpoints are _not_ meant to be selective. Their sole purpose is to give you sufficient foundational knowledge about Python and some important packages so you can start contributing to a project.

The definition of success for us is to have everyone who begins the tutorials finish them. Thus, we will offering support with Office Hours

## Submission

**Due: 09/15/2025 11:59pm EST**

Submitting checkpoints: [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfalQJnQ9-05xu0drsPsn7aKMYD9Xe9caCjRj87S1HCsH69EQ/viewform?usp=header)

We are looking for:

-   [**REQUIRED**] Checkpoint 0 and Checkpoint 1. These are assessed by completion and effort, not accuracy.
-   [**OPTIONAL**] Any additional challenges you completed. These are assessed by merit.

*If you completed the optional challenges, we will use your GitHub link to look through them. 

## Contact

All technical or logistical questions MUST be posted on the ED forum. We will not answer those questions over email.
